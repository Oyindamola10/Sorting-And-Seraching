Problem: Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works the way we sort playing cards in our hands. 
Each time we take a new card we put it in the right place in our hand. 
Each time work only with the first i-1 element from of the array
Pick element arr[i] and insert it into sorted sequence in the array from 0 to i-1.

Solution:
-Start a loop from the second element (index 1) to the last element in the array.
-For each element, store its value in current_element.
-Compare current_element with the elements in the sorted subarray (from 0 to i-1) by iterating backward.
-Shift elements to the right as long as current_element is smaller, effectively 
making space for current_element.
-Insert current_element into its correct position within the sorted subarray.
-Repeat these steps until you've processed all elements in the array.

InsertionSort(arr):
    for i from 1 to length(arr) - 1:
        current_element = arr[i]
        j = i - 1
        while j >= 0 and current_element < arr[j]:
            arr[j + 1] = arr[j]
            j = j - 1
        arr[j + 1] = current_element
